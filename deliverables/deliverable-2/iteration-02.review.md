## Process - Reflection
### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

Decisions that turned out well, ordered from most to least important:
- Separation of team
- Establishing communication expectations early on
- Regular weekly meetings
- Wednesday check-ins

#### Separation of team
Separating our team into back and front end teams, and further separating those subgroups into individuals responsible for specific views and features, has been the most important organizational decision we have made. It has allowed us to make as much progress as possible independently of each other (as we all have different schedules), to manage a large workload utilizing our total manpower, and to clarify responsibility and expectations.

#### Establishing communication expectations early on
Early in the course we decided to set clear expectations for how we would all communicate as a group. Since these expectations were set, we have all had a clear understanding of where everyone stands with regards to their progress on the project. Questions are responded to with a helpful attitude and the general atmosphere of the group is highly positive and helpful. Overall this decision was so successful because it took all the ambiguity out of the channels of communication so we could focus on the work.

#### Regular weekly meetings
In addition to setting communication expectations early on, we also set a weekly date for meetings. We meet in person for several hours. This allows us to hash out ideas far more quickly than we could over communication platforms or even online meetings. In addition, we are able to work on parts of the project together. Most of all, we know that every week, we will all be in one place, and can have any lingering questions or issues resolved between each other, and any remaining work tends to get done. We are fortunate to all live close enough to campus for this to be possible on a weekend, as it has made a huge difference in our effectiveness and cohesiveness. [You can see our weekly meeting agendas in this folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1r8x69vY3sCS-xi7c3GMZMdyTOLrmyXBJ) (see the Past Team Meetings folder for past meetings). 

#### Wednesday check-ins
Following the communication expectations and weekly meetings, we also check in mid-week with each other. As a mandated check-in, and one that happens in-person after a 301 class, we reduce the pressure on everyone to have immediate results every time they speak to the group as a whole. While this helps us gauge progress and plan work, it also has had the nice side effect of promoting a more open, honest and ego-less group dynamic, where we can admit when we are struggling (either with implementing a piece of the project, or with other course work that prevents our contribution in the short term).

*Special mention* goes to our snack provisions. At each weekly meeting we have one team member assigned to bringing snacks for the group! Not being distracted by hunger makes a big difference in how much work a group can get done in an afternoon.

### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped, ordered from most to least important:
- Friday online check-ins
- Voting on team conflicts

#### Friday online check-ins
Our mid-week check-ins have been successful, but our Friday online check-ins not so much. We are quite preoccupied as a group with school work and other obligations and Fridays tend to be quite busy. In addition, because we meet for a long interval on Sundays, the bulk of weekly work as a group tends to concentrate around the Sunday. There either hasn’t been strong participation or much to report at all for Friday check-ins, and because they are only online, they haven’t been as meaningful as our Wednesday check-ins. This decision has not proved to be very useful.

#### Voting on team conflicts
In creating documentation for deliverable 1, we also set expectations for how the group would resolve matters of conflict. In our case it was a decision related to the structure of our project’s backend. With a group of 7, ties are not possible but we had one member abstain from voting, leading to a tie. Rather than getting the majority of the group to agree on something, the decision was left to the flip of a coin. While there was no real resentment present in the group, it took some time for everyone to fully accept the path that had been selected. Now, we are all established and happy with what we chose, but we may have made better decisions on how to handle such a stalemate in our choices as a group.


It can be noted overall that the group generally agrees we have made a lot of good decisions in our process, decisions informed by (collectively) many bad group assignment experiences and a desire to do better. This makes it one of, if not the best, groups we have all had the pleasure of working in, in any computer science course here at U of T.

### Q3. Planned changes

Changes we are planning to make, ordered from most to least important:
- Working on version control branches
- Communicating long term goals with the team ahead of time

#### Working on version control branches
For this deliverable, we worked mostly in separate folders and tried to coordinate our commits and pushes in a loose fashion. We discovered the value of being a bit more organized with the structure of development on our Github repository. To avoid conflicts and enable more predictable development (i.e., features not breaking in some part of the app while, somewhere else in the app, a feature is being developed that relies on that feature to be working), we will be planning and structuring branches for each part of the app in advance of adding or modifying features.

#### Communicating long term goals with the team ahead of time
We had some issues with communication related to the development of our backend that arose because of changing needs in development. Because goals for each division of the team were not as tightly unified as they could have been, we believed that some parts were working with the required functionality when in fact there was still more work to be done, once it became clear that these goals were not aligned. We plan to prioritize what to work on *first* from now on, and ensure that we move together as a team instead of getting so fractioned into team divisions that we are not fully aware of what other divisions require.

## Product - Review
### Q4. How was your product demo?

Our partner was out of town and did not have time for technical setup, so our demo was prepared by showing the partner use cases of our apps in progress over a video call. We managed to demo the look of our web and mobile frontends, some basic tasks in those frontends, and explain in simplified terms how our backend would be set up. Our partner accepted the features, with some requests for extensions to those features (most notably asking for extended functionality in the way favourites work). The partner also requested the ability to download text and images from the app, and clarified some questions for us on the format of posts inside the app. We learned that it pays to keep in contact with the partner to ensure our development meets the partner’s needs at each stage, but even in doing so, the scope of a project is subject to change and we should remain adaptable (and construct our product in such a way that adapting to new needs is not unnecessarily complicated or restrictive).
