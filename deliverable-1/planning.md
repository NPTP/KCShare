# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME
> _Note:_ This document is meant to evolve throughout the planning phase of your project.   That is, it makes sense for you commit regularly to this file while working on the project (especially edits/additions/deletions to the _Highlights_ section). Most importantly, it is a reflection of all the planning you work you've done in the first iteration. 
 > **This document will serve as a master plan between your team, your partner and your TA.**

# Product Details
 
## Q1: What are you planning to build?

 > Short (1 - 2 min' read)
 * Start with a single sentence, high-level description of the product.
 * Be clear - Describe the problem you are solving in simple terms.
 * Be concrete. For example:
    * What are you planning to build? Is it a website, mobile app,
   browser extension, command-line app, etc.?      
    * When describing the problem/need, give concrete examples of common use cases.
    * Assume your the reader knows nothing about the problem domain and provide the necessary context. 
 * Focus on *what* your product does, and avoid discussing *how* you're going to implement it.      
   For example: This is not the time or the place to talk about which programming language and/or framework you are planning to use.
 * **Feel free (and very much encouraged) to include useful diagrams, mock-ups and/or links**.


## Q2: Who are your target users?

  > Short (1 - 2 min' read max)
 * Be specific (e.g. a 'a third-year university student studying Computer Science' and not 'a student')
 * **Feel free (but not obligated) to use personas.         
   You can create your personas as part of this Markdown file, or add a link to an external site (for example, [Xtensio](https://xtensio.com/user-persona/)).**

## Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

> Short (1 - 2 min' read max)
 * We want you to "connect the dots" for us - Why does your product (as described in your answer to Q1) fits the needs of your users (as described in your answer to Q2)?
 * Explain the benefits of your product explicitly & clearly. For example:
    * Save users time (how much?)
    * Allow users to discover new information (which information? And, why couldn't they discover it before?)
    * Provide users with more accurate and/or informative data (what kind of data? Why is it useful to them?)
    * Does this application exist in another form? If so, how does your differ and provide value to the users?
    * How does this align with your partner's organization's values/mission/mandate?

## Q4: How will you build it?

> Short (1-2 min' read max)
 * What is the technology stack? Specify any and all languages, frameworks, libraries, PaaS products or tools. 
 * How will you deploy the application?
 * Describe the architecture - what are the high level components or patterns you will use? Diagrams are useful here. 
 * Will you be using third party applications or APIs? If so, what are they?
 * What is your testing strategy?

## Q5: What are the user stories that make up the MVP?

 * At least 5 user stories concerning the main features of the application - note that this can broken down further
 * You must follow proper user story format (as taught in lecture) ```As a <user of the app>, I want to <do something in the app> in order to <accomplish some goal>```
 * If you have a partner, these must be reviewed and accepted by them
 * The user stories should be written in Github and each one must have clear acceptance criteria.

## Q7: What operational events will you have as a team?

>Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have.
 
Our team will be meeting weekly on Sundays, 12pm - 4pm in Bahen 2230, to plan out the work for the week’s sprint. Every member of our team has carved out time in their weekly schedule for this meeting, although if a group member is seeing their family, it is acceptable for them to join the meeting online from time to time. The purpose of every weekly meeting with the whole team will be to distribute tasks, create tasks and evaluate their difficulty as a group, present updates on development progress from the Technology Leads and Feature Leads, record questions to ask the client, and ensure that we are on track to meet our deadlines. 
 
Besides this weekly planning meeting with the entire team, we will also have meetings between the members of individual teams. 
* The Project Manager and Team Lead will have weekly meetings to coordinate the overall team direction in response to feedback from the client and current development progress. 
* The Technology Leads will meet weekly with Feature Leads and other programmers working in their section. In these meetings the team will coordinate development in that area, including coding all together to help others with their bugs or issues. 
* The Team Lead will coordinate meetings with the TA as needed on an ad hoc basis for meetings outside of tutorial, as our entire team intends to attend tutorial every week. 
 
Other meetings throughout the week will provide opportunities for the whole team to be updated on other’s progress:
* A physical standup (<10min) will take place with the whole team after class on Wednesday where each member will give a short update on what they have been working on since Sunday and what are planning to work on before Friday.
* A digital standup will take place on a dedicated Slack channel every Friday, where each team member is required to post an update on what they have been working on since Wednesday and what they will be working on before Sunday. 
 
On January 29th, we met with our project partners Andrea Fanjoy and Aisling O’Neill from Kingsway College. Our Project Manager, Ryan Marten, led the meeting and the other team members attended to participate. During this meeting we established expectations for our working relationship and helped define the needs of the users and the goals of the project. Minutes of this meeting can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y0D0B5wJx_wwJ-0ZDp41Fme8htqKAY5f_A7nMnJ-Q_c/edit#). We decided that the Project Manager will be meeting weekly with Andrea and Ash on Wednesdays at 3-4pm unless otherwise planned. The action items we came away with were: 
1) Completing the project planning document and emailing it to Andrea for her to review before submission to ensure we understood her vision and proposed problem space, 
2) Emailing a follow up with some questions that wanted to ask, but then ran out of time
3) Consulting our TA on when it would be best for Andrea to physically attend a tutorial and meet with us in person. 

  
## Q8: What artifacts will you use to self-organize?

>List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.      

We’ll be keeping track of what needs to get done using GitHub Projects. This allows us to break down work into its more granular constituent tasks and assign those tasks to each team member. It also allows us to raise issues in the GitHub repository in a manner tightly integrated with the planning tools. Keeping track of project milestones also means we’ll have regular larger goals to work towards, which will focus our efforts on higher-priority tasks.

A task will be prioritized based on how future needs depend on the completion or success of that task. If future work is unfeasible without the results of this task, it could be a roadblock in progressing to a successful milestone and thus the task should be given a higher priority. The primary goal of this project is to produce a functioning MVP, so that goal will guide prioritization of the work at a higher level (such as de-prioritizing extra features that might be “nice to have” but not absolutely necessary for the MVP).

Tasks will be assigned to team members at team meetings, where we can discuss the difficulty of each task and the desire of each group member to tackle the task. Tasks can also be requested through the GitHub Projects interface when group members are able and willing to take on the work. The status of work from inception to completion will be tracked through Projects, with tasks/notes moving through different columns representing the stages of progress and extra information being added to them as necessary.


## Q9: What are the rules regarding how your team works?

> Describe your team's working culture.

**Communication**: Team members will mainly communicate using Facebook Messenger. The purpose of this channel will be to confirm meetings, handle assignment questions and remind people to complete tasks. It will be the responsibility of the person asking the question to tag the people they are asking specifically. General questions can be posed to the group at large. While not strictly necessary, it will be seen as good etiquette to acknowledge important questions and answers by using thumbs up/down reactions to these messages. Expected response time will be at least once a day and no less.
 
In case of emergency, we have the group’s collected phone numbers pinned in a slack channel for texting and calling. This channel of communication is meant only for specific and rare cases.

 
The process for communicating with our project partner will be to set up meetings via email. A meeting agenda will be set before the meeting, with target outcomes to be reached by meeting end. These meetings will be in person or over Zoom (video call), and meeting minutes will be taken. After a meeting, we will send a follow-up email to the partner with the meeting minutes and action items that resulted from it.
 

**Meetings**: 
We will hold regular meetings for our team members. Members are responsible for attending the team meetings – if they are not able to make it, they must let the other attendees know as soon as possible. They must then make a plan to compensate for their absence. This could involve having someone present replace their role in the meeting or deliver an update on their behalf, and would also involves catching up on meeting contents to understand what new tasks they have.
 
Each meeting will have a Champion - the Team Lead for team meetings, the Project Manager for partnership meetings, and Tech Leads for tech meetings – whose duty it is to ensure that discussion in the meeting is productive and follows the set agenda.
 
**Conflict Resolution**: Team issues (not related to project task details) will be reported to the Team Lead to find appropriate resolutions. If the Team Lead is unavailable, these will go next to the Project Manager.
 
In the case that team issues involve conflict, we have the following contingencies prepared for various issues:

**Disagreements**: A disagreement might involve a lack of consensus on project tasks or technical concerns or even scheduling of team events. We commit to no shouting matches, only respectful dialogue. In the case that a conflict between two parties (1 or more persons per party) cannot be resolved by unmoderated discussion between those parties, each side of the disagreement will make a concise argument for their side of the issue (in text), send it to the Team Lead, and have the whole team vote. In the case of ties, the Team Lead will decide on the issue or delegate the decision to someone whose expertise is trusted on the issue. The emphasis is not on taking sides but keeping the project moving forward!

**Non-responsive team member**:  In the case that a team member does not respond within 1 day to messages on the agreed platforms, the Team Lead will contact the person by phone (text or call). If we still cannot reach that team member by the second day, the Team Lead goes to the team’s TA to report the issue.

**Good faith failure-to-deliver**: Sometimes even the best laid plans don’t work out. A feature that we believed could be completed in a week might need an extra week, or something that seemed simple could be complicated. The team members working on this task will have tried in good faith to complete the task but were unable. In this case it is their responsibility to let the Team Lead or Project Manager know what isn’t working so that plans can be reformulated.

**Bad faith failure-to-deliver**: If a team member is simply not putting in the effort (leading to a lack of completion of assigned tasks) and not communicating issues with the work to the team, the Team Lead will talk with this member about the issue and ask for a remedial plan to tackle the work or compensate otherwise. In the worst case, where this becomes a repeated issue, the Team Lead will report the member’s lack of contribution to the team’s TA to seek other solutions.

**Personal emergency**: Any team member experiencing a personal emergency is not expected to prioritize this class over their own wellbeing or that of those close to them, but they should do their best to let the team know what is going on as soon as they are able. This member’s workload will be redistributed among the team and project timeline as appropriate, and the Team Lead may speak to the TA to petition for extra time on deliverables should the member’s absence make the planned timeline too difficult to maintain.

**Other issues**: We cannot foresee every kind of issue that might arise; however, the team is committed to coming up with a plan to overcome roadblocks of any kind through shared communication on how to handle the issue.
